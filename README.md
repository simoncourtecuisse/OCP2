Heme Biotech

- New class created (SymptomsCounter)
- using HashMap to read symptoms.txt
- using TreeMap to list alphabetically the symptoms
- that creates result.out
- result.out is updated with the current time everytime (better tracking of the evolution)
- creation of an executable: AnalyticsCounter.jar

Corrected and Funtional Code
